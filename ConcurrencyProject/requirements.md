# Project Requirements

## Software Requirements
- **Java JDK**: Version 8 or higher (Tested with JDK 17 and JDK 23).
- **Eclipse IDE**: Latest version supporting Java.
- **JUnit 5**: For unit testing.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Project Features
1. **Simulate Concurrent Charging**:
   - Utilize Java Threads to simulate multiple energy sources charging a single battery concurrently.
   - Handle thread synchronization to prevent conflicts.

2. **Simulate Concurrent Battery Usage**:
   - Multiple devices consume energy simultaneously from the battery.
   - Include synchronization to ensure resource integrity.

3. **System Overload Control**:
   - Monitor system load during concurrent operations.
   - Implement mechanisms to avoid overloading resources.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Configure the classpath to include JUnit 5.
4. Run the main program (`EnergyManagementSystem.java`) or unit tests (`LogFileManagerTestSuite.java`).
